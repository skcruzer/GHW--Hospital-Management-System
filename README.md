# Hospital Management System 

## Description

What’s arguably the most important thing we focus on in our lives? It’s our health. There is no room for error when managing our health and our health providers need a simple, yet effective system to manage patients' health records and appointments all in one place. Our HMS is a computer system that helps manage the information related to health care and aids in the job completion of health care providers effectively. Admins/staff/doctors of small health clinics can use this application to easily access information about all employees, patients, and their appointments, as well as update/delete info.
